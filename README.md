Documents for my 2024 DSS master Thesis

Explored the capabilities of ML models to detect the use of LLMs for moral decision making in the Moral Machine Experiment (Awad et al., 2018).
Compared four models on three different datasets; datasets are all balanced.
(1) LR
(2) RF
(3) SVM
(4) Simple MLP
Found that Random Forest was the best on all datasets.
